# 🚀 Launching BGP Network on One of the Autonomous Systems

## 📌 Description
Border Gateway Protocol (**BGP**) is the standard exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among **autonomous systems (AS)** on the Internet. It is the *glue* of the Internet and a fundamental part of its infrastructure. However, it is also a prime target for attacks—if compromised, attackers can disrupt Internet connectivity.

Internet exchanges, autonomous systems, BGP routers, DNS infrastructure, and a range of services are among the fundamental components of the Internet that are provided by the project (as Python classes). These components can be used as building pieces by users to construct own programmable emulation. A collection of Docker container directories and files is the program's output. These containers create a miniature Internet when they are constructed and launched. Blockchain, botnets, and many other helpful aspects of the Internet are among the new building blocks that are being added.

## 📜 Program Walk-through

### 🔹 Task 1: Stub Autonomous System
- **Task 1.a:** Understanding **AS-155’s BGP Configuration**
- **Task 1.b:** Observing **BGP UPDATE Messages**
- **Task 1.c:** Experimenting with **Large Communities**
- **Task 1.d:** Configuring **AS-180**

### 🔹 Task 2: Transit Autonomous System
- **Task 2.a:** Experimenting with **IBGP**
- **Task 2.b:** Experimenting with **IGP**

### 🔹 Task 3: Path Selection

### 🔹 Task 4: IP Anycast




---

### 🌐 Key Learnings:

- Understood how **stub** and **transit** ASes are configured and how they influence BGP routing behavior.
- Simulated **prefix hijacking attacks**, demonstrating BGP’s vulnerabilities and the consequences of malicious route advertisement.
- Analyzed **BGP path selection**, **UPDATE messages**, **IBGP vs. EBGP**, and the use of **Large Communities** for advanced policy control.
- Explored the real-world application of **IP Anycast**, showcasing how the same IP can be advertised from multiple geographic locations.

---

### 🔐 Security Insight:

BGP is powerful—but not without flaws. Through this lab, we learned:

- How **misconfigurations** or **malicious behavior** can lead to **route hijacking** or **traffic interception**.
- The importance of deploying **RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)** and **BGP monitoring tools** to improve routing security.
- The need for **coordination among network operators** to ensure a resilient Internet backbone.

## ✅ Conclusion

This lab provided a comprehensive hands-on exploration of the **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**—the protocol that binds the global Internet together by enabling communication between Autonomous Systems (ASes).
